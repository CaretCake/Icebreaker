# Tri-Breakers

## Description

Our solution addresses what the global pandemic has revealed to be an ongoing issue with virtual education: student isolation. Our website of mini games remodels the concept of classroom icebreakers. The minigames allow students and teachers to build authentic trust and conversation through thrill-based gaming. Unlike most virtual icebreakers, our icebreakers incorporate teamwork. 

Our submission focuses on our drawing game. A 2 v 2 match: each pair has one artist and one explainer. The role of the explainer is to precisely describe the picture to the artist. Each explainer on both teams will be given the same picture and the artist will attempt to draw the picture that their partner describes as best as they can. Throughout the game, the artists will not be able to see the picture, and the explainers will not be able to see what the artists are drawing. 

The goal of our icebreaker games is to build a learning environment, where students feel comfortable enough to engage in and interact with one another by playing mini games that are teamwork-oriented. The website we created can be accessed and hosted through multiple sites such as IBM's Cloud services. 

We believe our submission is a standout. It addresses a gap in a virtual education icebreaker technique by incorporating teamwork to break-down student isolation. We've enjoyed this coding experience, and thank you for reviewing our submission.
